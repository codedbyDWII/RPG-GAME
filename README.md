🎮 Role-Playing Battle Game (Java OOP Project)

A turn-based role-playing game developed in Java that showcases object-oriented programming (OOP) principles including encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. Players face off against a computer-controlled opponent, each commanding a team of three unique units with randomly assigned levels, jobs, and stats.

Gameplay Features:

🧙‍♂️ Human vs. Computer Combat: Each side takes turns performing actions such as attacking or blocking.

⚔️ Strategic Mechanics: Job types (Mage, Knight, Archer) have dynamic strengths and weaknesses.

💥 Battle Simulation: Includes randomization, evasion, and damage calculation based on job advantages.

🧩 Automated Computer Strategy: The computer uses a decision algorithm to select optimal targets and moves.

🧾 Game Flow Control: Tracks turns, victory conditions, and displays battle updates.

Technical Highlights:

Built fully in Java using multiple custom classes (GameControl, Unit, HumanPlayer, ComputerPlayer).

Demonstrates OOP structure with constructors, fields, and methods to manage gameplay logic.

Implements input validation, random number generation, and conditional branching.
